Use the mouse wheel to move your selections and builds!

Requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/) and the [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config). To edit the configuration in-game, use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

I'm new to Java and modding, so just bear with me on that.

### Usage

- The available commands are `//move`, `//shift`, `//expand`, `//contract`, and `//stack`

- After doing a selection,  *toggle (default)* or *hold* `alt`¹ and scroll to move/shift/etc
- To change the command, *hold (default)* or *toggle* `ctrl`² and scroll.
- By default, you have to be in use mode (holding/toggled `alt`¹) to change modes (`ctrl`²). Disable 'Must hold the use key to activate the mod key' option if you want to be able to independently use both.
- While scrolling, hold `z`³ for 'alternate' scrolling. This is Vertical (up/down) by default but can be changed in the config along with normal scrolling behavior.
- You can give keybinds to each command

1: 'Use Selected Mode' keybind
2: 'Scroll through modes' keybind
3: 'Alternate Scrolling' keybind
