Use the mouse wheel to move your selections and builds!

Requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/) and the [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config). To edit the configuration in-game, use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

I'm new to Java and modding, so just bear with me on that.

- Use the mouse wheel to manipulate `//move`, `//shift`, `//expand`, and `//contract`.
- Change the mode by holding down `ctrl` (rebindable) and scrolling, or give each command its own keybind.
- Choose how vertical and horizontal scrolling moves something. You can also set alternative movements using a modifer key (default is `z`).
