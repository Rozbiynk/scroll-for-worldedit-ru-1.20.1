# Scroll for WorldEdit

Use the mouse wheel to move your selections and builds!

Requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/) and the [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config). To edit the configuration in-game, use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

I'm new to Java and modding, so just bear with me on that.

- Use the mouse wheel to manipulate `//move`, `//shift`, `//expand`, and `//contract`.
- Hold down `ctrl` to change the command, or give a command its own keybind.
- Horizontal scrolling only moves up and down, so you don't have to look away to move something vertically.
